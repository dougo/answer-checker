# answer-checker
A web-based tool for checking answers in puzzle hunts.

This will be a useful tool for our team going through old hunts while practicing for the MIT Mystery Hunt, but it's
also an exercise for me in two things:

1. creating a Rails app from scratch rather than using `rails new` (avoiding all the boilerplate and unnecessary
stuff it gives you by default); and

2. trying out Hotwire, Stimulus, and getting back to the server-rendering style of web apps.
